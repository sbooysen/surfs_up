# Surf and Ice Cream Shop Weather Analysis
## By: Stacey Booysen

### The Goal
For this analysis, we categorized weather temperatures for June and December to get a quick overview of what it would be like in different seasons. This was necessary to give an idea of whether or not the surf and ice cream shop would be able to succeed in all seasons. 

#### The most notable differences in the results were as follows:
  * The min temperature had the biggest difference between the two. December with 56 degrees and June with 64 degrees, creating an 8-degree difference.
  * The max temperature seemed to have the least variance between the two, coming in with December at 83 degrees and June at 85 degrees, creating only a 2-degree difference.
  * As could be expected, the low 25% average also has the biggest difference, reflecting the min’s average, with December at 69 and June at 73.

#### What the Data Shows
Overall, with the data provided, we see that there isn’t a massive difference in the weather averages for June and December. As shown in the tables below, there is about a 4-degree difference in the overall average of the weather between the two months. June’s average comes to 74.9 degrees while December has an average of 71.0 degrees. While the difference in degrees will be noticeable, they are both in a good range for surfing.

#### Additional Insight
To further get insight on the weather during June and December, it would help to pull up any information on severe weather that has occurred in the past during those months. If these storms are common, then it would be a good idea to take that into account when picking a precise location. 
Another factor that could be taken into consideration is the increase or decrease of the temperature between June and December, just to see if there’s a great variance as the seasons change. While taking peak months like June and December can be good for a quick overview of the weather on Oahu, it doesn’t take into account any changes that come with seasons transitioning. 
Since islands in particular tend to have ‘rainy seasons’ and ‘dry seasons’, it would also help to look into all of those months in order to determine any distinctive weather changes that might make the shop less profitable during those times. While both June and December each take place in the dry and rainy seasons respectively, they do not account for any changes over the other months in those seasons.

#### Conclusion
##### The future of the shop
Thanks to the data and the way we formatted it, the temperatures should be easy and simple to compare for June and December. Though there might need to be more months, dates, or weather types analyzed for a clearer picture, what we ran was a good summary. Due to the data we organized, it should be easier to get the board of directors to see the benefits of having the shop, as it can be profitable year-round. In the end, we were able to take a ton of data and make it palatable for the investors in order to hopefully get ourselves a shop in Hawaii.
